						<h1>How did Woods of Plenty&#0153; come to be?</h1>
						Through a lifelong passion for the forest, education, and healthy 
						living Woods of Plenty&#0153; developed as a means to enrich the thing we 
						loved the most; our native forests. The 80 acres of forest that we practice 
						in, in particular, has truly shaped who we are today. Woods of Plenty&#0153; 
						incorporates ideas and techniques from many different perspectives and 
						disciplines on sustainable land care and food production. 

					<br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>What does a cut at the root collar do?</h1>
						This is Phase 1: Invasive Management. Big bushes will desiccate, stop casting 
						shade, and no longer deposit seeds to the seed bank. Getting the big bushes 
						out of the way is a real game changer.

					<br>
					<br>
						
					    <h1>Won't the invasive plants just grow back?</h1>	
						Yes, to a degree. One return visit in the following years to cut small sprouts 
						will permanently reduce an invasive bush to just a tiny nub on the forest floor, 
						harming nothing and never again dominating. Native plants in the area and ones that 
						we plant will take over from there.
						
					<br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>So you have to cut everything again?</h1>
						Usually, but not always. Some bushes will die after the first cut. Our first 
						cut through of big bushes is the real time consumer and any second round cut is 
						an easy stroll through the forest.

                    <br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>Why don't you use Herbicides?</h1>
						Rachel Carson's Silent Spring helped us better understand the impact of using 
						chemicals. It is an incredible book and we recommend that you read it.

				    <br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>Why don't you dig the invasive plant's roots out?</h1>
						Digging disturbs the soil and creates conditions favorable to invasive seed 
						germination. Disturbed soil is more likely to wash away in a rain event. Root 
						fragments left behind will sprout. Way too much work.

					<br>
					<br>
					
					    <h1>Does Woods of Plenty&#0153; do timber stand improvement (TSI)?</h1>
						Timber stand improvement is usually part of the path to cutting down trees, 
						which is not a major part of our business. However, we are sensitive to the needs 
						of the forest. Sometimes diseased trees are a detriment and need to go. Sometimes 
						invasive plants and vines are hindering tree growth. So, yes, you will have more 
						straight growing and healthy trees after our work is finished.

					<br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>Can Woods of Plenty&#0153; landscape my backyard?</h1>
						Typically we don't do this kind of work, as we prefer to be in the woods. We are 
						here to help though, with no forest too small. If you have a yard with a nice 
						stand of trees, want to install some new native species, establish a new stand 
						of trees, a butterfly garden or a bird sanctuary, perhaps a consultation with 
						Woods of Plenty&#0153; will fulfill your needs.

					<br>
					<br>
					
						<h1>I am hands on. Can I get involved with Woods of Plenty&#0153; as my forest is being transformed?</h1>
						We encourage it! Join us in the labor and see your forest transform first hand. 
						We will answer all your questions and share our forest knowledge with you.

					<br>
					<br>	
						
						<h1>How quickly will I see a difference/ be able to start harvesting?</h1>
						As soon as we start working there will be a noticeable difference in the density and 
						visibility in your forest. Within a year there will be access to more fruits that already 
						existed in your Woods of Plenty&#0153;. Our tailored plantings take some years to mature but 
						it's worth the wait! 

					<br>
					<br>
						
						<h1>This is all overwhelming! Realistically, what can I do?</h1>
						We understand. With persistence great changes can happen in your forest. A forest 
						moves at it's own pace, give it time. A great first move is to hire Woods of Plenty&#0153; 
						to cut grape and bittersweet vines. Gavin and Jeff can cut a dense 1 acre of vines in 
						2 hours. They have counted, and make about 1200 vine cuts/hour.
